#+title: Learn Biomarker Analysis

* What Is A Biomarker
** FDA Definition
"A defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure of intervention, including therapeutic interventions. Molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiologic characteristics are types of biomarkers. A biomarker is NOT an assessment of how an individual feels, functions, or survives."

*** Examples
Lab based (LIPIDs), Genetic Biomarker (histologic, blood, fluid, CSF, etc), Radiographic (MRI, PET), composite biomarkers, digital biomarkers.

** Fundamental Pharmacology Questions for Biomarkers
- Drug exposure at target site of action
- Binding to pharmacological target (Engagement/Occupancy)
- Expression of pharmacology (PD effect)

** Evidence Taken Together Integrated Framework for Decision-Making
 - Several PD biomarkers over several phases of clinical development constitute a complete picture of the drug's mechanism in the body from minutes to hours and days of drug administration
   - Vaidating target engagement
   - Selection of optimal dose
   - Identifying potential early efficacy and/or safety
   - Identification of patient subgroup likely to respond from treatment with the drug
   - Help design combination therapies

 - Pfizer has defined three pillars of survival of a drug through clinical development in order to progress to phase III. The drug condidate must demonstrate:
   - Exposure at the target site of action over a desired period of time
   - Binding to the pharmacological target as expected for its mode of action
   - Expression of pharmacological activity commensurate with the demonstrated target exposure and target binding

- May be different from a prognostic biomarker
- May need drug-diagnostic co-development
- Identify early efficacy/safety
- Identify potential subgroup who responds to treatment
- Help design combination therapies

** Three Basic Desings for Predictive-Biomarker Enabled Trials
- Biomarker Identified Subgroup

- Biomarker Stratified Design
  - Test Biomarker, randomize both postive and negative separately for treatment and control
- Biomarker Adaptive Desing
  - Test Biomarker, try stage I on both positive and negative patients, successful group go to stage II.

* Section III: Surrogate Biomarkers/Endpoints
 -- Correlated with Treatment Effect on Clinical Endpoint

** Objectives of Surrogate Biomarkers
NIH (USA) defines surrogate endpoint as "A biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint"

**Surrogate Endpoints** are used instead of cinical outcomes in some clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints are used when the clinical outcomes might take a very long time to study, or in cases where the clinical benefit of improving the surrogate endpoint, such as controlling blood preasure, is well understood. Clinical trials are needed to show what surrogate endpoints can be relied upon to predict, or correlated with clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints that have undergone this setting are called vaidated surrogate endpoints and these are accepted by the FDA as evidence of benefit.

Between 2010 and 2012, the FDA approved 45% of new drugs on the basis of a surrogate endpoint.

- Regulatory hurdle for getting a biomarker approved as a surrogate
- Surrogate could save time in trials if observed earlier than clinical endpoint
- Outline
  - Definition of surrogate biomarkers
  - Meta-analysis framework
  - Within-trial framework
  - Proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE)

The FDA (R) categorizeds surrogate endpoints in roughly three hierarchical categories:
- Candidate surrogate endpoint
- Reasonably likely surrogate endpoint (Approval is conditional)
- Validated surrogate endpoint (Approval is regular)

Few examples:
- Time to Progression (TTP)
- Progression Free Survival (PFS)
- Response Rate (RR)

A. Disease -> Intervention -> Surrogate endpoint -> True clinical output
B. Disease -> Surrogate endpoint
           -> True clinical output
C. ...

** Strong Correlation of Association between S and T and Captures Full Effect of Treatment on T

Prentice Criteria
Normal Dist Endpoint

Quantify surrogate between endpoints has two requirements:
- Requirement #1: Trial Level - Assess the ability of the treatment effect of the surrogate endpoint to predict the true endpoint (\(R^2_{trial}\))
- Requirement #2: Individual Level - Assess the correlation between the surrogate and true endpoints after adjusting for treatment (\(R^2_{indiv}\))
  - Copula Model Implementation via R package "surrosurv" for the endpoints

** Example: Examining the Proportion of Treatment Effect:
- Hughes (*) shows the two methods for determining PTE on AIDS clinical trials
  - T = Progression to AIDS or Death after 6 Months
  - S = Change in CD4 cell count
  - R code given based on Zamboni PhD dissertation to create bivariate distribution of data with and without surrogate endpoint as a predictor. Data used is AIDS data set released with Hughes seminal paper
    - Produce PTE and CI for each trial; and overall
- Bayesian Linear Regression
  - R code given on same data set
- CD4 count is surrogate for HR (Bayesian estimate how slope excludes 0; but intercpt does not)

* Projects
** Flow Cytometry
*** Understanding Flow Cytometry:
- Cell Characterization: Flow cytometry can differentiate cells based on size, granularity, and fluorescence intensity. This is achieved by labeling cells with fluorescent markers that bind to specific cell components or proteins.
- Quantification: It quantifies how many cells express a particular marker (cell count) and the proportion of these cells relative to the total cell population (percentage).

**** Using Cell Counts and Percentages as Biomarkers:
1. Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring:
   - Cancer: For example, in leukemia and lymphoma, abnormal levels or proportions of certain white blood cells can be indicative of disease.
   - Immunological Disorders: Changes in the percentages of T-cell subsets (like CD4+ and CD8+ cells) can indicate immunological disorders, including HIV/AIDS.

2. Therapeutic Monitoring:
   - Response to Treatment: In cancer therapy, changes in tumor cell populations or immune cells can indicate the effectiveness of treatment.
   - Autoimmune Diseases: Monitoring specific immune cells can help in assessing the response to treatments in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.

3. Transplantation Medicine:
   - Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD): Post bone marrow transplant, the proportions of donor vs. recipient cells can be critical in monitoring GvHD or transplant rejection.

4. Research and Drug Development:
   - Pharmacodynamics: Assessing how a drug affects specific cell populations.
   - Biomarker Discovery: Identifying new biomarkers for diseases based on unique cell population characteristics.

5. Personalized Medicine:
   - Tailoring Therapies: Flow cytometry data can guide personalized treatment plans, especially in oncology, by understanding individual patient’s tumor and immune cell characteristics.

**** Advantages:
- Highly Specific: Can target specific cell types or even subtypes.
- Quantitative and Qualitative Data: Provides both numerical data and information on cell characteristics.
- Rapid and Sensitive: Can process and analyze millions of cells quickly.

**** Limitations:
- Requirement for Expertise: Interpretation of flow cytometry data requires specialized knowledge.
- Standardization Issues: Variability in protocols and reagents can affect reproducibility across different labs.

In summary, flow cytometry's ability to provide detailed and quantifiable information on cell populations makes it an invaluable tool in using cell counts and percentages as biomarkers for a wide range of clinical and research applications.
