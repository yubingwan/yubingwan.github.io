<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Clinical trials are conducted in distinct phases, each with specific characteristics, objectives, and study designs.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Phase I
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Small-scale trials, often including 20-100 healthy volunteers (sometimes patients).</li>
<li>Assess safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.</li>
<li>Typically non-randomized, open-label, often using a dose-escalation study design.</li>
<li>Focus on determining maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phase II
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Larger groups (100-300 participants), usually patients with the disease/condition.</li>
<li>Evaluate the efficacy of the drug and further assess its safety.</li>
<li>Often randomized controlled trials (RCTs), can be single-blind or double-blind.</li>
<li>Establishing the preliminary efficacy, optimal dose, and short-term side effects. Power and sample size calculations are crucial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phase III
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Large-scale trials, involving 300-3,000+ participants, typically from multiple sites.</li>
<li>Confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare with standard or equivalent treatments.</li>
<li>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Often multi-center studies.</li>
<li>Emphasis on confirmatory data analysis, interim analysis, handling multicenter data, and comprehensive safety analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phase IV
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Post-marketing studies conducted after a treatment is approved and on the market.</li>
<li>Further information including drug&rsquo;s risks, benefits, and optimal use.</li>
<li>Can vary widely, including randomized and non-randomized designs, observational studies.</li>
<li>Long-term effectiveness and safety, pharmacoeconomics, real-world evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org6cc3e79" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6cc3e79"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> General Biostatistician Aspects to Consider Across Phases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Sample Size Determination:</b> Crucial in all phases for ensuring statistical power.</li>
<li><b>Randomization:</b> Reduces bias and confounding variables, particularly important in Phase II and III.</li>
<li><b>Blinding:</b> Important for reducing bias in treatment assignment and outcome assessment.</li>
<li><b>Statistical Analysis Plans:</b> Must be well-defined and documented before the trial begins.</li>
<li><b>Handling Missing Data:</b> Strategies for dealing with dropouts and missing values.</li>
<li><b>Interim Analysis:</b> Particularly in Phase III, for early signals of efficacy or safety concerns.</li>
<li><b>Regulatory Compliance:</b> Adherence to statistical guidelines from regulatory authorities like FDA or EMA.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each phase of a clinical trial has distinct statistical considerations. Biostatisticians play a critical role in the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trial data, ensuring that the results are robust, valid, and ethically obtained.

<li>Drug discovery and approval in oncology is mediated by the use of imaging to evaluate drug efficacy.</li>
<li>Imaging is performed while patients receive therapy to evaluate their response to treatment.</li>
<li>RECIST 1.1 are standardized and can be used at different time points to classify response into the categories of
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CR: complete response</li>
<li>PR: partial response</li>
<li>SD: stable disease</li>
<li>DP: disease progression</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the trial level, categorical responses for all patients are summated into image-based trial endpoints.</li>
<li>These outcome measures, including
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ORR: objective response rate</li>
<li>PFS: progression-free survival</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They are characteristics derived from imaging and can be used as surrogates for overall survival (OS).</li>
<li>OS, ORR and PFS all describe the efficacy of a drug.</li>
<li>FDA regulatory approval requires therapies to demonstrate direct evidence of clinical benefit, such as improved OS.</li>
<li>Multiple programs have been created to expedite drug approval for life-threatening illnesses, including advanced cancer.</li>
<li>ORR and PFS have been accepted by the FDA as adequate predictors of OS on which to base drug approval decisions, thus substantially shortening the time and cost of drug development (1).</li>
<li>Use of imaging surrogate markers for drug approval has become increasingly common, accounting for more than 90% of approvals through the Accelerated Approval Program and allowing for use of many therapies which have altered the course of cancer.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.aimetrics.com/comparing-ai-metrics-to-manual-methods/">Comparing AI Metrics to Manual Methods</a>
AI Metrics increased reporting accuracy by 25%, reduced errors by 99%, cut interpretation time in half, increased inter-observer agreement among oncologists by 58% and among radiologists by 45%, and was preferred by 96% of radiologists and 100% of oncologists compared to current practice with manual image assessments and text reports. In a study of the beta version of the AI Metrics Platform (called eMASS; included guided workflows and annotation tools, but no AI algorithms), eMASS reduced errors and time of evaluation was twice as fast, which indicated better overall effectiveness than standard of care, manual tumor response evaluation methods for three different therapy response criteria.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Defination:</b> Biomarker data refers specifically to data that is indicative of a biological state or condition. Biomarkers (short for biological markers) are measurable indicators of some biological state or condition. They can be molecules, genes, gene products, enzymes, hormones, or other substances whose presence or concentration can be measured in biological samples like blood, tissue, or urine.</li>
<li><b>Purpose:</b> Biomarker data is typically very specific and scientific, often requiring specialized methods for collection and analysis. It can include levels of specific proteins, the presence of certain genetic markers, or the concentration of particular metabolites, among others.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Addressing intercurrent events using estimand strategies is a crucial aspect of clinical trial design and analysis, enhancing clarity and transparency in how we handle post-randomization events that could affect the interpretation of treatment effects. Estimands aim to precisely define the target of estimation to address the specific clinical question of interest, taking into account the complexities introduced by intercurrent events. Here are some steps and considerations for incorporating estimand strategies to deal with intercurrent events as a lead biostatistician:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Define Your Estimand</li>
</ol>
<p>
Start by clearly defining your estimand according to the ICH E9(R1) guideline, which should include a precise definition of the target population, endpoint(s), and the treatment effect(s) of interest in the presence of intercurrent events. This involves specifying the clinical question you aim to answer and the relevant population characteristics.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Identify Intercurrent Events</li>
</ol>
<p>
Intercurrent events are events that occur after treatment initiation and can affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest. Common examples include use of rescue medication, discontinuation of treatment, and occurrence of a major health event. Identifying these events early in the trial design is crucial for proper estimand formulation.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Choose an Appropriate Strategy</li>
</ol>
<p>
The ICH E9(R1) guideline outlines several strategies for addressing intercurrent events within the framework of estimands. These include:
</p>

<p>
Treatment Policy Strategy: Include all data, regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events, to reflect the treatment effect under the treatment policy being studied.
Composite Strategy: Combine the primary variable of interest with the intercurrent event into a composite endpoint.
Hypothetical Strategy: Estimate what the outcomes would have been without the intercurrent events.
Principal Stratification Strategy: Focus on a subgroup of participants who are not affected by the intercurrent events.
While on Treatment Strategy: Analyze data only up to the occurrence of the intercurrent event.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Implement Appropriate Statistical Methods</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a strategy, select statistical methods that align with your estimand. This might involve methods for handling missing data, such as multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting, or more complex models like causal inference techniques, depending on the chosen strategy.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Document and Justify Your Choices</li>
</ol>
<p>
Document your estimand strategy and the rationale for your choice, including how you plan to handle each identified intercurrent event. This documentation should be part of your statistical analysis plan (SAP) and protocol, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Sensitivity Analyses</li>
</ol>
<p>
Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of your findings to different assumptions about the handling of intercurrent events. This can provide insights into the impact of these events on the treatment effect estimate.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Communicate with Stakeholders</li>
</ol>
<p>
Engage with clinical and regulatory stakeholders early and throughout the trial process to ensure alignment on the estimand strategy and its implications for clinical decision-making.

<h3 id="orgfae0217"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> What are intercurrent events, give me some examples</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Intercurrent events are occurrences after the initiation of treatment in a clinical trial that can affect the interpretation of the primary outcome, either by changing the course of the disease under study or by influencing the measurement of the primary outcome. These events pose challenges in assessing the true effect of the treatment being studied. The concept of intercurrent events is central to the framework of estimands, as defined in the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Here are some common examples of intercurrent events:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use of Rescue Medication</li>
</ol>
<p>
Participants may receive additional treatments or interventions not specified in the study protocol to manage symptoms or adverse reactions, which can confound the effects of the study treatment.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Treatment Discontinuation</li>
</ol>
<p>
Participants may stop the study treatment prematurely for various reasons, such as experiencing side effects, perceiving lack of efficacy, or personal choice. This can complicate the assessment of long-term treatment effects.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Switching Treatments</li>
</ol>
<p>
In some cases, participants might switch to an alternative treatment during the study. This switch could affect the disease progression independently of the study treatment.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Missing Data</li>
</ol>
<p>
Missing data, resulting from participants dropping out of the study or missing scheduled assessments, can introduce bias if the reasons for missing data are related to the treatment or outcome.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Death</li>
</ol>
<p>
Death is a critical intercurrent event, especially in studies where survival or life-extension is the primary endpoint. It requires careful consideration in the analysis to accurately reflect the treatment&rsquo;s impact on survival.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Major Health Events</li>
</ol>
<p>
Events such as hospitalization, surgery, or the occurrence of a new illness can impact the outcome of interest or the ability to measure it accurately.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Protocol Deviations</li>
</ol>
<p>
Violations of the study protocol, whether intentional or accidental, by participants or investigators, can affect the treatment&rsquo;s perceived efficacy and safety.
</p>

<p>
Handling these intercurrent events appropriately in the analysis is crucial for drawing valid and reliable conclusions about the treatment&rsquo;s effects. The choice of strategy to address these events should be guided by the clinical question of interest and the context of the disease and treatment under investigation.

<h3 id="orgc6fa5b0"><span class="section-number-3">5.3.</span> How to handle biomarker endpoint (exploratory) with primary and secondary endpoints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
When a lead biostatistician in a Contract Research Organization (CRO) is involved in exploring biomarker endpoints, especially in the exploratory phase of a clinical trial, there are several important considerations regarding sample size calculation. Whether there is a need to redo sample size calculation specifically for the biomarker endpoint depends on various factors, including the objectives of the biomarker analysis, the relationship between the biomarker and primary/secondary endpoints, and the statistical properties of the biomarker itself. Here are some key points to consider:
</p>

<p>
Objectives of Biomarker Analysis
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exploratory vs. Confirmatory: If the biomarker analysis is purely exploratory, intended to generate hypotheses rather than confirm them, a formal sample size recalculation may not be strictly necessary. However, having a sufficient sample size to observe a meaningful signal is still important for the credibility of any findings.</li>
<li>Decision-making: If the biomarker is critical for future decision-making, such as selecting doses for later-phase trials or identifying responder subgroups, a more rigorous approach to sample size determination may be warranted to ensure the reliability of these decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Relationship to Primary/Secondary Endpoints
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Correlation with Clinical Outcomes: If the biomarker is strongly correlated with the primary or secondary endpoints, the original sample size may already offer sufficient power to detect meaningful changes in the biomarker. However, this depends on the strength of the correlation and the variability of the biomarker.</li>
<li>Independent Analysis Goals: If the biomarker endpoint serves a distinct purpose or addresses a separate question from the primary/secondary endpoints, a separate sample size calculation based on the expected effect size, variability, and desired power for the biomarker analysis may be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Statistical Properties of the Biomarker
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variability: Biomarkers often have different variability characteristics compared to clinical endpoints. High variability may necessitate a larger sample size to detect a given effect size.</li>
<li>Effect Size: The expected effect size for the biomarker may differ from that of the primary/secondary endpoints, potentially requiring adjustment to the sample size calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Practical Considerations
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Resource Limitations: In the context of a CRO, resource constraints such as budget and time can also influence the feasibility of increasing sample size based on biomarker analyses.</li>
<li>Regulatory Guidance: Consideration of regulatory expectations for biomarker-based analyses, especially if the biomarker might later transition to a more pivotal role in the study or program.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Steps to Take
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Preliminary Analysis: Conduct a preliminary analysis to assess the variability and potential effect size associated with the biomarker.</li>
<li>Statistical Methods: Employ statistical methods tailored to biomarker analysis, which may include simulation studies to estimate the required sample size under different scenarios.</li>
<li>Consultation: Engage with clinical and scientific experts to understand the clinical relevance of changes in the biomarker and to align on the objectives of the biomarker analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In conclusion, while there may not always be a need to formally redo the sample size calculation for exploratory biomarker endpoints, considering the specific objectives and statistical properties of the biomarker analysis is crucial. A careful evaluation will help ensure that the study is appropriately powered to yield informative and credible results, supporting the overall goals of the clinical program.

<h3 id="org1868de1"><span class="section-number-3">5.4.</span> What are common biomarker assays used in oncology and immuno-oncology trials?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
In oncology and immuno-oncology trials, biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding the mechanism of action of therapies, predicting responses, and monitoring disease progression. The landscape of biomarker assays is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in technology and a deeper understanding of cancer biology. Here are some popular biomarker assays currently used in these fields:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</li>
</ol>
<p>
IHC is widely used for the detection and localization of proteins within tissue sections. It is particularly useful for assessing the expression of tumor antigens, checkpoint proteins (e.g., PD-L1), and other markers that may predict response to immunotherapy.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</li>
</ol>
<p>
PCR, including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), is a sensitive method for detecting gene mutations, amplifications, or expression levels of mRNA. It&rsquo;s commonly used for identifying specific oncogenic mutations or viral DNA associated with certain cancers.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)</li>
</ol>
<p>
NGS allows for the comprehensive analysis of genetic mutations, gene expression profiles, and other genomic alterations. Its applications in oncology include whole-genome sequencing, targeted gene panel sequencing, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). NGS is instrumental in identifying actionable mutations and predicting responses to targeted therapies.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>
ctDNA assays detect and quantify tumor-derived DNA fragments in the blood, offering a non-invasive approach to cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment response. This &ldquo;liquid biopsy&rdquo; technique is gaining traction for its ability to detect minimal residual disease and emerging resistance mutations.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Flow Cytometry</li>
</ol>
<p>
Flow cytometry is used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles in a fluid as it passes through at least one laser. It&rsquo;s particularly useful for characterizing immune cell populations, assessing leukocyte differentiation status, and quantifying markers of activation or inhibition in the context of immuno-oncology.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Multiplex Immunoassays</li>
</ol>
<p>
Multiplex immunoassays, such as Luminex or cytometric bead array, allow for the simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines, growth factors, and other soluble proteins in a single sample. This capability is valuable for profiling the immune response and understanding the cytokine milieu within the tumor microenvironment.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)</li>
</ol>
<p>
TMB is assessed through comprehensive genomic profiling and quantifies the number of mutations within a tumor genome. A higher TMB may predict a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, making it a valuable biomarker in immuno-oncology.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Mismatch Repair (MMR) Deficiency Testing</li>
</ol>
<p>
MSI and MMR deficiency are biomarkers for certain types of cancer, indicating a predisposition to accumulate genetic mutations. These markers are particularly relevant in colorectal cancer and have implications for responsiveness to immunotherapy.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>T-cell Receptor (TCR) Sequencing</li>
</ol>
<p>
TCR sequencing analyzes the diversity and clonality of the T-cell repertoire within a tumor or peripheral blood, providing insights into the immune response to cancer and the potential efficacy of immunotherapies.
</p>

<p>
These assays are critical tools in the design and execution of oncology and immuno-oncology trials, enabling personalized medicine approaches that match patients with the most appropriate therapies based on their biomarker profiles. As research progresses, the use of these and emerging assays will continue to refine our understanding of cancer biology and enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments.

<div id="outline-container-org26fab4b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org26fab4b"><span class="section-number-3">5.6.</span> Can the measurements of these targets be included as exploratory or third endpoints in oncology or immuno-oncology trials?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-6">
<p>
Yes, measurements of these targets can indeed be included as exploratory or third endpoints in oncology and immuno-oncology trials. Incorporating these measurements as exploratory endpoints serves several important purposes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Biomarker Validation</li>
</ol>
<p>
Including measurements of genomic, proteomic, and cellular targets as exploratory endpoints allows for the validation of these biomarkers in the context of the clinical trial. This validation process is crucial for understanding the biomarker&rsquo;s role in the disease process and its potential utility in predicting response to therapy or in patient stratification.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Mechanism of Action (MoA) Elucidation</li>
</ol>
<p>
Exploratory endpoints can help elucidate the mechanism of action of the investigational therapeutic. By measuring changes in specific targets, researchers can gain insights into how the therapy interacts with its target and the downstream effects on signaling pathways, potentially identifying mechanisms of resistance or synergies with other therapies.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Identification of Predictive Biomarkers</li>
</ol>
<p>
The analysis of these targets may help identify predictive biomarkers that could foresee which patients are likely to benefit from the therapy. This is particularly relevant in immuno-oncology, where responses to treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors can vary widely among patients. Predictive biomarkers can improve patient selection for specific therapies, enhancing clinical trial efficiency and facilitating personalized medicine approaches.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Safety and Toxicity Monitoring</li>
</ol>
<p>
Measurements of certain targets can also be used to monitor for potential adverse effects related to the therapy. For example, changes in immune cell populations or cytokine levels could indicate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in trials involving immunotherapies.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Secondary Pharmacodynamic (PD) Endpoints</li>
</ol>
<p>
These measurements can serve as secondary PD endpoints, providing evidence of drug activity at the intended target site or within a specific biological pathway. PD endpoints are invaluable for dose-ranging studies and for establishing the relationship between drug exposure and biological effect.
</p>

<p>
Practical Considerations
Feasibility and Relevance: The feasibility of measuring these exploratory endpoints and their relevance to the therapeutic area and study goals must be considered. This includes the availability of validated assays and the biological rationale linking the target to the disease.
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP): The SAP should clearly outline the methods for analyzing exploratory endpoints, including statistical techniques and handling of multiplicity issues. While exploratory analyses may not be subject to the same statistical rigor as primary or secondary endpoints, clear planning is essential for generating meaningful insights.
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations: Any additional measurements, especially those requiring extra patient samples or procedures, should be justified in terms of scientific value and patient burden. Ethical and regulatory considerations must be addressed, ensuring that the collection of data aligns with study objectives and patient welfare.
Incorporating these measurements as exploratory endpoints in clinical trials offers a valuable opportunity to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, therapeutic effects, and patient responses, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective and personalized cancer treatments.
